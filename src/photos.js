        description: 'Is an important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates. Is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. I visited in 2015 and it was amazing to do the hike along the montain. It takes us 2 hours to arrive to the top. I wanted to go, because is a special area and because I read some years ago the Geisha is memories and the description of that spot cathed me.'

        description: 'is one of the most celebrated temples of Japan. It was founded in 780 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in the wooded hills east of Kyoto, and derives its name from the fall is pure waters. Kiyomizudera is best known for its wooden stage that juts out from its main hall.The stage affords nice views of the numerous cherry and maple trees below that erupt in a sea of color in spring and fall, as well as of the city of Kyoto in the distance. I visited too in the same trip in 2015, and I fall in love because all the cherrey blossom were bloom an it was amazing to see that spot with the Fuji Mountain in the background of the lanscape.'

        description: 'At the heart of Kyoto lies Gion, the city’s most famous entertainment district and the center of its traditional arts. Today Gion is known as Kyoto’s most famous geisha district. Packed with bars, restaurants and traditional teahouses, Gion is at its most atmospheric in the early evening, when the lanterns are lit and apprentice geisha will flit about the back streets on their way to their appointments. I visited the district during the afternoon and I had it the pleasure to see Maikos and a Geisha walking in the street. They had a special aura and sophisticated way to walk and flow movements. '
