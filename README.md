# Vue

In this repository, I will use Vue to build a SPA (Single Page Application). For future features I would like to do the backend to be able to save the images that I upload.

## Setup & Run

1. Type `npm install` to install packages.
1. Type `npm run dev` to run the development server.
1. Point your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Add two views - one for the user and one for the admin

- Clicking on "Admin" should show the admin view, and clicking on "User" should show the user view.

- The Admin view has form that should accept an URL, a description, and a title.
- If you click the button reset, all the inputs will be erased.
- If you click the button summit, the image should appear on the user view page.
